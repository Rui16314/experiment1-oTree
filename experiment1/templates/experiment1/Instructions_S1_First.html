  <h3>SESSION 1: FIRST-PRICE SEALED BID AUCTION</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Matching: <strong>random each round</strong> (new opponent every round).</li>
    <li>Price rule: <strong>first-price</strong> (highest bid pays their own bid).</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Payoff rule</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>If your bid &lt; opponent’s bid → you lose and receive 0.</li>
    <li>If your bid &gt; opponent’s bid → you win and your points are:
      <div class="formula">Your points = Your valuation − Your bid</div>
    </li>
    <li>If the bids are equal, the winner is chosen at random; payoff is computed as above.</li>
  </ul>
