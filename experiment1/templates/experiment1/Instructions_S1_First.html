  <h3>SESSION 1: FIRST-PRICE SEALED-BID AUCTION</h3>
  <p>You will play {{ ROUNDS }} rounds in pairs. At the start of each round you are paired
     <strong>randomly</strong> with another participant.</p>

  <p>The seller auctions one indivisible item to two buyers. In each round you submit a sealed bid.</p>

  <p>Each round your valuation and your opponent’s valuation are drawn independently and uniformly
     from 0 to 100 (in cents). With probability 1/10,000 your valuation equals 0.01·n for n in 0…10,000.</p>

  <p>After learning your valuation, you have <strong>1 minute</strong> to submit a bid. You won’t see your
     opponent’s bid until the round ends, when you also learn whether you won and how many points you earned.</p>

  <h4>Points in each round depend on</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Your bid</li>
    <li>Your opponent’s bid</li>
    <li>Your valuation</li>
  </ol>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>If your bid is lower than your opponent’s, you lose the auction and get 0 points.</li>
    <li>If your bid is higher, you win the auction. In a <strong>first-price</strong> auction
        your points are:
        <div class="eq">
          <img src="{% static 'img/first_eq.png' %}" alt="Your points = Your valuation − Your bid">
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>If bid equalities are resolved randomly, the winner is chosen at random among tied high bids.</li>
    <li>If you don’t submit a bid within 1 minute, you get 0 points.</li>
  </ul>
