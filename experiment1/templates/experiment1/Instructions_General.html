  <p>Welcome to the ECON 3310 Experiment Platform.</p>
  <p>The experiment has two parts, each with three sessions. In each session you will play
     <strong>{{ ROUNDS }}</strong> rounds of an auction game.</p>
  <p>Participating in this experiment will earn you <strong>100 points</strong>.</p>
  <p>In every round you receive a private valuation drawn independently and uniformly between
     0 and 100.</p>
  <p>After learning your valuation, you have <strong>1 minute</strong> to submit your bid. If you do not submit a bid in time,
     you receive <strong>0 points</strong> for the round.</p>
  <p>At the end of the round you will learn whether you won, the winning bid, and how many points you earned.</p>
