  <h3>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
  <p>Welcome to the ECON 3310 Experiment Platform.</p>
  <p>
    The experiment has two parts, each with three sessions. In each
    session you will play <strong>{{ ROUNDS_PER_SESSION }}</strong> rounds of an
    auction game (60 rounds total). Each round is expected to take about a minute.
  </p>
  <p>Participating in this experiment will earn you <strong>100 points</strong>.</p>
  <p>
    In every round you receive a private valuation drawn independently and
    uniformly between 0 and 100 (in cents). With probability 1/10,000 your
    valuation will be 0.01n where n is from 0â€“10,000.
  </p>
  <p>
    After learning your valuation, you have <strong>1 minute</strong> to submit your bid.
    If you do not submit a bid in time, you receive <strong>0 points</strong> for the round.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of the round you will learn whether you won, the winning bid,
    and how many points you earned.
