  <h3 class="mb-2">GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
  <p>Welcome to the ECON 3310 Experiment Platform.</p>
  <p>The experiment has two parts, each with three sessions. In each session you will play
     <strong>10 rounds</strong> of an auction game (60 rounds total in the whole study).
     Each round is expected to take about 1 minute. Total time including instructions is about 75 minutes.</p>
  <p>Participating in this experiment will earn you <strong>100 points</strong>.</p>
  <p>In every round you receive a private valuation drawn independently and uniformly between 0 and 100 (in cents).
     With probability 1/10,000 your valuation will be 0.01n where n is from 0â€“10,000.</p>
  <p>After learning your valuation, you have <strong>1 minute</strong> to submit your bid. If you do not submit a bid in time,
     you receive <strong>0 points</strong> for the round.</p>
  <p>At the end of the round you will learn whether you won, the winning bid and how many points you earned.</p>
