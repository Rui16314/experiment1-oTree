<h3>SESSION 6: REPEATED SECOND-PRICE WITH COMMUNICATION</h3>

<div class="callout">
  <p>
    Same as Session 5: you are paired with the
    <strong>same opponent for all {{ ROUNDS_PER_SESSION }}</strong> rounds.
  </p>
  <p>
    New in this session: you may <strong>chat</strong> with your opponent before submitting your bid.
    Keep your identity confidential and keep messages on-topic.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Matching:</strong> <em>fixed</em> — same opponent each round.</li>
  <li><strong>Communication:</strong> chat available before bidding in every round.</li>

  <li><strong>Time limit:</strong> you have 1 minute to submit a bid each round.</li>
  <li><strong>Payoff if you win:</strong> your valuation − opponent’s bid; otherwise 0.</li>
