expected to take about one minute. The whole experiment should take no more

You can earn extra points in each round; points from all rounds are added up,
so every round matters.</p>

<h3>SESSION 1: FIRST-PRICE SEALED BID AUCTION</h3>
<p>You will play 10 rounds of this game. At the start of each round, you are
paired with another participant (matching method: <b>{{ matching_text }}</b>).</p>
<p>In each round there is an indivisible item. Both of you are interested in buying it.
You privately receive a <b>valuation</b> for the item (0–100 points). Your
opponent’s valuation is not revealed until the round ends.</p>

<h4>How to play each round</h4>
<ul>
  <li>You have 60 seconds to submit a bid.</li>
  <li><b>Price rule:</b> {{ price_rule_text }}.</li>
  <li>If your bid is higher than your opponent’s, you win and your points are
      <b>your valuation − the price you pay</b>.</li>
  <li>If your bid is lower, you lose and earn 0 points.</li>
  <li>If you don’t submit a bid in time, you earn 0 points.</li>
</ul>

<p>After each round, you see who won, both bids, both valuations, the price,
and your points for the round.</p>
